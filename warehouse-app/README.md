# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Notes
Ramda has been used to increase readability for list and object operations. Also for increased calculation speed.
# Limitations
No implemetation of loading state has been done. Very fast response times makes for flickering UI in this case.
The lists are infinite, which makes for bad preformance. Either make infinite scroll lists or support backend pagination.
